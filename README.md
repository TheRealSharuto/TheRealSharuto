👋🏾 Hi, I’m @TheRealSharuto , or in other words, Shara Belton! 
Currently, I am a Development Assistant, and I help out with web development and web content maintenance. However, I am in the process of pivoting into data - and will be producing projects that spin me in the direction towards Data Science in hopes of getting some experience before I apply to grad school!

💃🏽 My hobbies lie in dance, anime + webtoons + manga, reading scientific papers, drawing, meditation, pilates/yoga, writing, and ofcourse, coding!

🌱💻 I’m currently learning R, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI. Furthing skills in Python, JavaScript (Vanilla, jQuery, React), HTML, CSS.

🏫 Education
+ Bachelor's of Science in Kinesiology
+ Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science
+ Harvard Professional Certificate in Data Science in progress on edX
+ Continuing Education on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)!

Feel free to follow my education progress on my edX and Kaggle courses [here](https://www.presentingshara.com). I will also be blogging about different interesting research papers and books I come across in relation to data science.
