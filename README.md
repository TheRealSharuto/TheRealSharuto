👋🏾 Hi, I’m @TheRealSharuto , or in other words, Shara Belton. My current goal is to become a software engineer! 
Currently, I am a Development Assistant, and I help out with web development and web content maintenance. 

💃🏽 I’m interested in in dance, anime, manga, drawing, pilates/yoga, writing, and ofcourse, coding!

🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Python, Java, and php.

💻 I’m looking to collaborate on software development projects.
