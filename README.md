👋🏾 Hi, I’m @TheRealSharuto , or in other words, Shara Belton! 
Currently, I am a Computer Operator, and I help out with RelativityOne Automation using the API and I help with e-discovery processing. I plan on continuing in e-discovery and either branching out into digital forensics or continuing Relativity development and IT work.

💃🏽 My hobbies lie in dance, reading scientific papers, drawing, meditation, pilates/yoga, writing, and ofcourse, coding!

🌱💻 I’m currently learning Powershell as well as the Relativity platform and it's API as of January 2025. I'm dabbling into some C# and studying for Relativity and IT certifications.

🏫 Education
+ Bachelor's of Science in Kinesiology
+ Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science
+ Studying for Relativity Certifications
