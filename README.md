👋🏾 Hi, I’m @TheRealSharuto , or in other words, Shara Belton! 
Currently, I am a Computer Operator, and I help out with RelativityOne Automation using the API and I help with e-discovery processing. I plan on adapting with the future of AI and automation and contributing to the technology by going on a path of Data Engineering/Gen AI engineering.

💃🏽 My hobbies lie in dance, reading scientific papers, drawing, meditation, pilates/yoga, writing, and ofcourse, coding!

🌱💻 I’m currently studying for a Relativity certification as a priority for my job. On the side, I am dabbling here and there in material regarding the Elastic Engineer and AWS certifications.
